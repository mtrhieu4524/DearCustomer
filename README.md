## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in vite
npm create vite@latest
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run tauri dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
