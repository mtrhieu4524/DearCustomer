## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in vite
npm create vite@latest
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run tauri dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build

# or build in tauri
npm run tauri build
```
